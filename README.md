# FishMercury_ShinyApp
A R shiny app that maps fish mercury distribution patterns in space-time across Ontario for a long-term period (1970-2015). 

This is a very simple version of a Shiny web app that shows Mercury levels in five key sport fishes found in inland lakes of Ontario province, Canada.

(This app is in development;in future we plan to incorprate more spatial details and GIS layers/functionalities.)

2. Hover the pointer on the map data points and click on any point to open a pop-up window with more details regarding the sampling event . Zoom if required.

3. Calender settings can be changed by clicking on the 'date range' options for all dates ranging from 1970 to 2015. Please provide full calender details (i.e. year, month, and date). Click on 'radio buttons' to change the fish species.

4. After making any change click on the 'Create/Update Map' to view the changes.
